# WeatherApp
This is the Weather App V1. In this app you start of with a default city that's set in the code. The main page will show the current high for that city, 
the condition of the city on that day. It will also tell you humidity, wind pressure and wind speed on that day as well. There is also a seven-day forecast 
so that you can see how the weather is looking throughout the week. There's a search bar to search for other cities. You can save multiple cities for future 
observations as well as delete the cities that you saved. And you can also change the Units of Measurements from F to C. A very modern app with industry 
standard methods and technologies.
